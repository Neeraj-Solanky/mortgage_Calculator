**Project Title:** **Mortgage Eligibility Checker**

**Description:**  
This project is a FastAPI-based web application that helps users determine their eligibility for a mortgage loan. By taking inputs such as monthly income, credit score, loan amount, and property value, the application evaluates eligibility based on predefined criteria. If the user is found ineligible, it provides detailed reasons for ineligibility and suggests actionable steps to improve eligibility, such as increasing income, enhancing credit score, or reducing the loan amount.

The app includes:  
1. A robust eligibility checking mechanism considering income thresholds, credit scores, and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.  
2. Clear explanations and actionable suggestions for improving loan eligibility.  
3. An intuitive API endpoint accessible via Swagger UI (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`).  

**Technologies Used:**  
- **FastAPI** for building the API.  
- **Python** for backend logic.  
- **Uvicorn** as the ASGI server.  
- **Dotenv** for secure environment variable management.
